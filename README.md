This program is the LuLab germplasm database management system.

# 1. Structure

Here is the scheme of the database:
1. Germplasm table: a curated table that we need;
2. passport: a table that contains the passport information from world wide germplasm collections;

# 2. Rules

The curated germplasm information was chosen in the role of: Institute information > Genesys/Eurisco > Wiews.
Besides, the germplasm uses InstCode+AccessionNumber as the primary key.
